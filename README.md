# GO

- Go is a compiled language.

- Go is a statically typed language - declare variables explicitly or the type should be inferred. These variables cannot be changed until type conversion.

    Example:

    - Explicit declaration: `var name string`

    - Type inferred: `var name = "Dhruv"`


- Go is also a strongly typed language. I.e., the operation you can perform on a variable depends on the variable type.

- Statically and Strongly typed language enables the Go compiler to thoroughly check code for errors.

- Go has built in concurrency - Goroutines
